I decided to migrate my website to [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/), a static site generator written in Rust.

My friend [Trix](https://trix.is-a.dev/) made a site using the same theme, [Ametrine](https://ametrine.daudix.one/), and I really liked how it looked. So I thought, why not? After all, I've wanted to turn my site into a sort of personal blog for quite a while now.

It itches a bit because I'm used to building my own tools and having full control over what I do. But I also want something that works well and doesn't require as much maintenance. I have many pending projects and I don't want to add more work to my list.

A clear sign of my tendency to want to control everything is my move to Linux (about 4 years ago now) and projects like [Ax-Shell](https://github.com/Axenide/Ax-Shell) or its successor [Ambxst](https://github.com/Axenide/Ambxst). But sometimes, it's better to use existing tools that work well instead of reinventing the wheel.

"Sometimes" is actually "most of the time," but when it comes to creating, *sometimes* it's inevitable to want to do it all yourself. :)

## Why?

Well, this is the part where I start talking about my feelings and motivations. But I'd like to go into more detail about that in a future entry (and maybe in a video, since I'm really looking forward to returning to [YouTube](https://youtube.com/Axenide)).

In short, I've wanted to have a website since I was a kid, and when I finally learned how... Social media happened. I felt like the purpose was lost, that it no longer made sense to have a personal site. Social networks have their algorithms, infrastructure, and community, and it's easier to reach people there.

But in recent years, I've felt a lot of nostalgia for the classic web, for those personal sites and blogs I used to visit. I want to recapture that feeling and share my thoughts, projects, and experiences in a more authentic and personal way.

## What's next?

Well, like many things I do, this is an experiment. I don't know exactly where it will lead me, or if I'll have the consistency to maintain it. But I want to try.

And well, that's it. I had to hold myself back from writing a full essay in this first entry, which makes me realize I have a lot to say. So, I might actually be active after all. :)
